photomosaics
============
Make beautiful photomosaics with this program. 

1) First install all images from the Flickr MIR Dataset (http://press.liacs.nl/mirflickr/).
These files need to be concatenated into a single folder named "images".

2) Run in the following manner: 

python processing.py


python mosaics.py {file name of image} {pixel size of tiles}
